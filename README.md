Project to further understanding of Bureau of Labor Statistics data data available via the BLS public API. 

Initial setup will be to pull specific seriesIDs down, validate there is data available, and create dataframes for use in performing simple graphical analysis. 

Next steps will hopefully aim to create a more comprehensive ETL project along with visualizations via streamlit or mage!
